# ocr-api-stack

Infrastructure for the OCR Service stack.

This consists of one or more ECS Clusters. Each Cluster has a ELB with one microservice (`ocr-api`)

## Performance Variables

These are configured in the profile environmental vars files (no defaults set):

|     Variable                     | Destroy | Description                                                                       |
|---                               |--- |---                                                                                |
| `ec2_instance_type`              | Y | See [AWS Instance Types)[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/]              |
| `number_of_tasks`                | ? | The number of instances of the `ocr-api` task to run                                |
| `machine_cpu_count`              | ? | The number of vCPUs the `ocr-api` uses.                                             |
| `machine_amount_of_memory_mib`   | ? | The amount of memory in MiB to allocate to the `ocr-api`.                                  |
| `ocr_tesseract_thread_pool_size` | N | The number of threads used in the `ocr-api` application for Tesseract processing (Image to text) |
| `ocr_queue_capacity`             | N | The capacity of the queue used in the `ocr-api` application for Tesseract processing (Image to text) |


- The **"Destroy"** column signifies that the environment should first be destroyed before applying this change to the environment (the main problem seems to be when we change to a more powerful environment),
- If you create a cluster with **more than two tasks,** only two tasks will be running after creation,
- **Make sure that the CPU and Memory values are in the range of the ec2_instance_type.**  The instance type might define the overall memory and CPU in the cluster - Need to confirm (getting inconsistent results). When these do NOT match, the plan will be made and applied but fail in deployment with no clear error messages.

## Internal / external naming

Notes on the internal / external naming:

- internal = DNS names within the AWS cluster that are only used for traffic within (internal to) the environment
- external = DNS names exposing specific services to users outside (external to) the cluster e.g. other CH services, testers etc
- so its not a public/private thing its how functionality/services are used - within the cluster is internal DNS, outside users require the external address.

## Secrets

No secrets are required in this application stack

## Dashboard

The OCR Service dashboard was originally created via the AWS Cloudwatch console. Then the source was exported via (Actions->View/edit source menu option).

This original source file was changed to:

- Replace environmental related values with a variable (i.e. ` "SOURCE '/ecs/ocr-api-parent1/ocr-api'  -> "SOURCE '/ecs/ocr-api-${environment}/ocr-api' `)
